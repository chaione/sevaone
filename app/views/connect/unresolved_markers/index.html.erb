<h1>Unresolved Markers</h1>

<p>
  These are map markers from the <a href="http://disasterconnect.io/">Disaster Connect app</a>
  that have unresolved needs.
</p>
<p>
  As an admin, you have the ability to mark these needs as resolved. Once a need is marked as
  resolved, it will remain hidden from public view and this screen as well.
</p>
